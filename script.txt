Hi. My name is Tim and welcome to OpenBarriers.
	A website where you can ride trains in London for free.
		Yes. For. Free.
			Well, how does it work?
				Imagine going to your local train station and you've noticed there are open barriers. Now you 'could' enter a train for free,
				but you would have no way of knowing if there are inspectors on the train or even open barriers on the other side. Without
				that knowledge it just isn't worth the risk. Until now.
			
				Now when you eVnter your local train station you can simply visit OpenBarriers.co.uk to check if your destination train station has
				OpenBarriers or not, so you can ride from your station to another, for free, all without risk. Just return the favour by letting
				us know if your station is open so others can do the exact same thing.

				OpenBarriers even shows where inspectors were last spotted so you can ride safely and in peace.

				Visit OpenBarriers.co.uk next time your train station has open barriers and see where the world can take you. And make sure to 
				share this with a friend. The larger the community the more up to date and secure OpenBarriers will be.

		See you soon. Sincerly,
		From OpenBarriers to you.
